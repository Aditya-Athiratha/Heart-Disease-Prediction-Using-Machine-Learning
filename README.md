In recent times, Heart Disease prediction is one of the most complicated tasks in the medical field. 
In the modern era, approximately one person dies per minute due to heart disease. Machine Learning plays
a crucial role in processing huge amounts of data in the field of healthcare.
As heart disease prediction is a complex task, it is necessary to automate the prediction process to 
avoid associated risks and alert the patient well in advance. This project makes use of the heart disease 
dataset available in the UCI machine learning repository(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php). 
The work focuses mainly on predicting the chances of Heart Disease and classifies patients' risk levels 
by implementing different supervised learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, 
Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
